    "summary": "The coefficient algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra on a finite-dimensional representation is defined as the subalgebra generated by all coefficients of the corresponding characteristic polynomial. We explore connections between classical invariant theory and the coefficient algebras of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras on some representations. Specifically, we prove that with respect to any symmetric power of the standard representation: (a) the coefficient algebra of the upper triangular solvable complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials; (b) the coefficient algebra of the general linear complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the invariant ring of the general linear group with the conjugacy action on the full space of matrices; and (c) the coefficient algebra of the special linear complex Lie algebra can be generated by classical trace functions. As an application, we determine the characteristic polynomial of the special linear complex Lie algebra on its standard representation.",

    "summary": "We prove that both, the embedding of the category of Hopf algebras into that of bialgebras and the forgetful functor from the category of Hopf algebras to the category of algebras, have right adjoints; in other words: every bialgebra has a Hopf coreflection and on every algebra there exists a cofree Hopf algebra. In this way we give an affirmative answer to a forty years old problem posed by Sweedler. On the route the coequalizers and the coproducts in the category of Hopf algebras are explicitly described.",

    "summary": "The main properties of the crossed product in the category of Hopf algebras are investigated. Let $A$ and $H$ be two Hopf algebras connected by two morphism of coalgebras $\\triangleright : H\\ot A \\to A$, $f:H\\ot H\\to A$. The crossed product $A #_{f}^{\\triangleright} H$ is a new Hopf algebra containing $A$ as a normal Hopf subalgebra. Furthermore, a Hopf algebra $E$ is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to a crossed product of Hopf algebras $A #_{f}^{\\triangleright} H$ if and only if $E$ factorizes through a normal Hopf subalgebra $A$ and a subcoalgebra $H$ such that $1_{E} \\in H$. The universality of the construction, the existence of integrals, commutativity or involutivity of the crossed product are studied. Looking at the quantum side of the construction we shall give necessary and sufficient conditions for a crossed product to be a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra. In particular, all braided structures on the monoidal category of $A #_{f}^{\\triangleright} H$-comodules are explicitly described in terms of their components. As an example, the braidings on a crossed product between $H_{4}$ and $k[C_{3}]$ are described in detail.",
